## Repositories

### secondorder-web

**Repository:** [secondorderai/secondorder-web](https://github.com/secondorderai/secondorder-web)  
**Language:** TypeScript  
**Status:** Active Development  
**Last Updated:** January 2, 2026

#### Description

The main web application for SecondOrder AI, implementing a new layer of LLM applications with meta-thinking capabilities.

#### Key Features

- **AI Integration**: Integrates Vercel AI chat with AI gateway supporting multiple GPT models (gpt-5-mini, gpt-5.2, gpt-5.1-thinking)
- **Meta-Thinking Implementation**: Dynamic thinking layer on top of LLMs for adaptive chain of thoughts
- **Self-Improving Systems**: Multi-step, self-improving processes that autonomously audit their own progress
- **Advanced Reasoning**: Harnesses LLM world knowledge for better reasoning and problem-solving
- **Solver Builder**: Tools for creating and managing AI solvers with integrated tooling
- **Self-Learning Memory**: Adaptive learning mechanisms that improve over time
- **Model Selection**: Automatically selects optimal combinations of models and approaches

#### Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15.5.9
- **Runtime:** React 19.0.0
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 3.4.17
- **Testing:** Vitest 4.0.16, Playwright 1.57.0
- **Language:** TypeScript 5.7.2
- **Node Version:** Specified in `.nvmrc`

#### Core Concepts

**Meta-Thinking in AI:**
Meta-thinking refers to an AI system's ability to reflect on its own cognitive processes, decisions, and learning mechanisms. Key aspects include:

1. **Self-Monitoring**: Real-time observation and evaluation of performance and outputs
2. **Self-Evaluation**: Assessment of decision quality, correctness, and appropriateness
3. **Adaptive Learning**: Using insights from self-reflection to improve future performance

**Iterative Problem-Solving Loop:**
- Generate potential solutions
- Receive and analyze feedback
- Refine solutions using LLM
- Build toward perfect answers incrementally

**Self-Auditing Process:**
- Autonomously audits its own progress
- Decides when sufficient information is gathered
- Determines solution satisfactory
